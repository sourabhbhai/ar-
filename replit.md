# AR Restaurant Management System

## Overview

This is a comprehensive restaurant management system with AR (Augmented Reality) menu viewing capabilities. The application features three distinct user interfaces: a super admin panel for complete system management, restaurant owner dashboards for order management, and customer-facing AR menus accessible via QR codes.

The system enables restaurants to showcase their dishes in 3D/AR format, allowing customers to visualize meals before ordering. Orders are processed in real-time using WebSocket connections, providing instant notifications to restaurant owners.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.
